# Python_Elzero
## Overview
### This repository contains my solutions, assignments, and exercises from the Mastering Python course by Eng. Osama Elzero (Elzero Web School). The content covers a comprehensive range of Python programming concepts, from foundational basics to advanced topics, designed to build a strong foundation for data science and machine learning applications. This work demonstrates my proficiency in Python programming, problem-solving, and implementation of key concepts relevant to AI and software development.
### Contents
*The repository includes code and projects organized by lesson topics, including:*

*Python Basics: Variables, conditionals, loops, functions, and data types (lists, sets, dictionaries, tuples).
Data Structures: Implementation of lists, sets, dictionaries, and tuples for efficient data handling.
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Classes, objects, inheritance, and encapsulation.
File Handling: Reading, writing, and managing files in Python.
Regular Expressions (Regex): Pattern matching and text processing.
Database Interaction: SQLite integration for data storage and querying.
NumPy: Array manipulation and numerical computations for data science.
Assignments & Exercises: Practical problems solved to reinforce concepts, including real-world coding challenges.*

### Skills Demonstrated

*Programming: Proficient in Python for general-purpose and data science applications.
Problem-Solving: Tackled numerous coding exercises to develop logical and analytical thinking.
Data Science Foundations: Applied NumPy for numerical computations and SQLite for database operations.
Code Organization: Structured, well-documented code following best practices.
Version Control: Managed projects using Git and GitHub for collaboration and version tracking.*

### How to Use

*Clone the Repository:git clone https://github.com/Ahmed-7-ML/Python_Elzero.git*


### *Navigate to a Lesson Folder: Each folder corresponds to a specific topic (e.g., Basics, OOP, NumPy). Run the Code: Most scripts are written in Python 3 and can be executed using:python script_name.py*

### Dependencies: Install required libraries (e.g., NumPy) using:pip install numpy


*Learning Outcomes
Through this course, I have:*

**Mastered Python fundamentals and advanced concepts for software development.
